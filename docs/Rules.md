# RULES & THRESHOLDS (RULES V12)

**Lovable Trade V13 - "Visual Layer" Edition**
**Updated: February 5, 2026**

## Overview

This file defines all visual mappings, color tokens, thresholds, and display standards. It is the bridge between scoring (SA/MC/MS) and the UI.

Chart Scaling Logic:

Price is the base. The Y-axis domain is defined by the min/max of the price series (stock price or QQQ).
All other series (Score, VIX, MC) are scaled to fit within the price range using: scaledValue = minPrice + (value / 100) * priceRange
VIX is inverted before scaling: (100 - VIX) so high VIX appears low on the chart (bearish = down).
Right Y-axis shows raw 0–100 scale for reference.
Amplification multiplies each series' deviation from the price midpoint: amplifiedValue = midPrice + (scaledValue - midPrice) * amplifyLevel where amplifyLevel is 1x–4x per series.

This scaling ensures all indicators visually overlay on the price, making crossovers and divergences between score trends and price movements immediately visible.
