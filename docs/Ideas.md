# Optimization and Signal Ideas



# Lovable Trade V17 — Optimization Ideas
**Backtest Reference: Oct 20, 2025 (QQQ -2.49%, MC 32) | Jan 6, 2026 (QQQ -4.23%, MC 30)**
**Common stock universe: 102 stocks across both dates**

---

## Idea 1 — Increase Unprofitable Penalty
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Q4 (Net Profit Margin)
**Change:** Add -3 penalty when NPM < 0% (currently scores 0, no penalty)
**Impact (70+ stocks):**
- Oct 20: ✅ Removes RKLB (71→69, -35.2%) | ✅ Removes INTC (70→67, -7.8%) | ⚠️ NTRA stays at 70 (winner +15.8%)
- Jan 6: ✅ Removes TXG, NTRA, RKLB | ⚠️ MRNA drops (winner +14.6%)
- Net: -3 to -5 FPs per date, -1 winner risk

---

## Idea 2 — Filter Crypto Completely
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Q20 (Sector Preference)
**Change:** Crypto stocks (IREN, MARA, CLSK, RIOT, BITF, WULF, HUT, CIFR, COIN, MSTR, CORZ, BTBT, HIVE, BTDR) excluded from buy signals regardless of SA score
**Impact:**
- Oct 20: ✅ Removes IREN (71, -22.6%)
- Jan 6: ✅ Removes IREN (71, -13.3%)
- Net: Clean removal, no collateral damage

---

## Idea 3 — Cap Basic Materials to 1 Selection
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Signal/portfolio rule
**Change:** Max 1 Basic Materials stock in buy list. If multiple qualify, take highest SA score only.
**Impact:**
- Jan 6 80+: HL, B, NEM, KGC, NGD, CDE, SCCO, AEM all scored 80+ — mixed winners/losers
- Reduces sector concentration risk without scoring change
- ⚠️ Does not fix underlying scoring — only limits exposure

---

## Idea 4 — P/E Penalty for Extreme Valuations
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Q23 (High P/E Momentum Trap)
**Change:** Apply -4 penalty when P/E > 100 (positive P/E only)
**Impact (70+ stocks):**
- Oct 20: PLTR(195)→-4, SHOP(120)→-4 | WGS(1258) winner drops ⚠️
- Jan 6: NBIS(231), PLTR(195), KTOS(800) drop below 70 ✅
- ⚠️ -4 insufficient to remove PLTR/SHOP from 80+/70+ on Oct 20

---

## Idea 5 — Growth Questions Cap (Q1+Q2+Q3+Q12 ≤ 13pts)
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Q1 (Sales Growth), Q2 (Op Income Growth), Q3 (Cash Flow Growth), Q12 (EPS Growth)
**Change:** Combined points from Q1+Q2+Q3+Q12 cannot exceed 13. Excess removed from raw score before normalization.
**Rationale:** FPs score higher on growth questions than winners — growth inflation masks weak price action.
**Impact (common 102 stocks):**
- Jan 6 80+: 61.5% → 66.7% (+5.1%) | FPs 5→4
- Jan 6 70-79: 44.1% → 46.7% (+2.5%) | FPs 19→16
- Oct 20 80+: 60.0% → 60.0% (0%) | FPs 4→2 ✅ no damage
- Oct 20 70-79: 53.6% → 55.2% (+1.6%) | FPs 13→13

---

## Idea 6 — Healthcare Q20 Penalty: +1 → 0
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Q20 (Sector Preference)
**Change:** Drop Healthcare from +1 to 0 (neutral). Covers Pharma and Biotech which have no sub-sector distinction in data.
**Rationale:** Biotech/Pharma binary event risk not captured by current scoring. All Healthcare appears identical in sector field — no sub-sector available.
**Impact (65+ stocks):**
- Jan 6: Only shifts scores by 1pt. No group changes for 80+. JNJ drops 70→69 (winner ⚠️). Removes NVO(69→68, FP).
- Oct 20: No group changes. All major HC winners (INCY, LLY, VRTX) stay in their groups. Clean.
- Net: Minimal impact — 1pt reduction across all HC stocks. Low risk, low reward.

---

## Idea 7 — MC Threshold: No New Buys for 70-79 When MC < 30
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Module 4 Signals — Condition 3 (Regular Market)
**Change:** When MC 15-29, restrict buy signals to SA ≥ 80 only. 70-79 group gets "No New Buys" instead of "Selective Buy".
**Rationale:** Jan 8 (MC=28) had 10/21 FPs in 70-79 group. These are ordinary underperformers indistinguishable by SA alone. MC filter eliminates them without SA changes.
**Current rule:** MC 15-29 → "Growing Market" → buy 70+ stocks
**Proposed rule:** MC 15-29 → buy 80+ only | 70-79 = No New Buys
**To test:** Run across all dates with MC 15-29 and measure FP reduction vs winner loss

---

---

## Idea 8 — Block Buy Signal if 5-Day Drop ≥ 5%
**Status:** Proposed
**Target:** Module 4 Signals — Buy signal suppression rule
**Change:** Do not issue a Buy signal for any stock where `Past 5D %` ≤ -5%, regardless of SA score.
**Applies to:** All score groups (80+, 70-79, 60-69)
**Does NOT change:** SA score, rank, or display — stock still appears in results, signal becomes "Hold / Watch"

**Rationale:** A 5%+ drop in the last 5 days signals active selling pressure. Even high-scoring stocks entering a slide have poor 1M forward returns. Waiting for stabilization reduces false positives without changing the scoring model.

**Backtest Results (20 dates, all score groups):**

| Score Group | Base WR | Filtered WR | Stocks Blocked | FPs Saved | Winners Lost | Net |
|-------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| 80+ | 54.2% | 55.6% | 4 | 4 | 0 | **+4** ✅ |
| 70-79 | 51.7% | 51.6% | 15 | 7 | 8 | -1 ⚠️ |
| 60-69 | 50.0% | 52.0% | 18 | 13 | 5 | **+8** ✅ |

**Key findings:**
- 80+: Perfect filter — all 4 blocked stocks were FPs. Zero collateral damage.
- 60-69: Best relative impact — +2% WR, net +8 FPs saved.
- 70-79: Slight negative at this threshold — blocks more winners than FPs. Consider raising threshold to -7% for this group only.
- Fires rarely (4–18 blocks per group across 20 dates / ~900 total stocks) — low-frequency, high-precision.

**Implementation note:** F2 (block if 1D + 5D + 1M all negative) was also tested — zero net benefit across all groups. Not recommended.

## Score movements signals
# Score Movement Signal Table — V17
*Based on Nov 2025 snapshot, 62 stocks, 3-day confirmation rule*
*(Day 0 = trigger, Day 1 = still holds, Day 2 = ACT)*

---

## ENTRY SIGNALS

| Signal | Condition | MC Zone | Win% | Avg 1M% | Action |
|--------|-----------|---------|------|---------|--------|
| Best Entry | Cross above 80, holds 3 days | 30-50 | 78.4% | +11.1% | Buy |
| Best Entry | Cross above 80, holds 3 days | 70+ | 73.7% | +10.6% | Buy |
| Best Entry | Cross above 80, holds 3 days | 50-70 | 69.6% | +8.8% | Buy |
| Fear Entry | Cross above 80, holds 3 days | <30 | 66.7% | +19.3% | Buy — higher return, lower certainty |
| Secondary | Cross above 75, holds 3 days | 30-70 | 70.8% | +10-12% | Buy |
| Avoid | Cross above 75 or 70, holds 3 days | 70+ | 47-64% | +1-4% | Skip — market too extended |
| Dip Buy | Gradual drop 5pts over 4 days, lands 75+, no recovery >1pt | Any | 78-89% | +10-20% | Buy the dip |

---

## EXIT SIGNALS

| Signal | Condition | MC Zone | Win% (stock still wins) | Avg 1M% | Action |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------------------|---------|--------|
| Strong Exit | Drop below 65, holds 3 days | 30-50 | 43.3% | -12.5% | Sell immediately |
| Strong Exit | Drop below 65, holds 3 days | 70+ | 50.0% | -8.3% | Sell |
| Strong Exit | Drop below 70, holds 3 days | 50-70 | 0.0% | -9.3% | Sell immediately |
| Strong Exit | Drop below 70, holds 3 days | 70+ | 15.4% | -10.5% | Sell immediately |
| Mild Exit | Drop below 75, holds 3 days | 50-70 | 35.0% | -1.7% | Sell |
| Ignore | Drop below 65 or 70, holds 3 days | <30 | 53-61% | -2 to +4% | Hold — market oversold, stock often recovers |
| Gradual Decline | 5pts over 4 days, lands <65, no recovery >1pt | 30-50 | 48.5% | -2.1% | Sell |

---

## NOISE — DO NOT ACT

| Condition | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Drop below 80, recovers within 1 day | 33% of all 80-crossings — false alarm, avg +4.6% |
| Score rises 5+ points into any zone | No predictive value — worse than stocks already in zone |
| Score drops 5-10 pts, stock above 75 | Recovers, avg +14.75% — buy the dip instead |
| Any signal when MC <30 | Market weakness masking score drops — wait for MC recovery |
| Cross above 70 or lower | Below 75, signals are too weak to act on |

---

## Confirmation Rule

- **Day 0** — Score crosses threshold (trigger)
- **Day 1** — Next market open, still holds
- **Day 2** — Day after, still holds → ACT

Waiting filters out 39-46% of false signals with no meaningful cost to return.

---

## Key Boundaries

| Line | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 80 | Elite zone entry — confirmed crossing is the primary buy signal |
| 75 | Secondary entry, only valid in MC <70 |
| 70 | No-man's land — not worth entering or exiting on its own |
| 65 | The real danger line — confirmed drop = exit regardless of origin |
| MC 30 | Below this, exit signals weaken — market, not stock, may be the cause |

# SA Score Optimization Ideas
**Baseline:** Oct 20, 2025 | 75+ ex Basic Materials | N=18 | Win% 55.6%

-----

**Idea 1:** Sector filter — exclude Basic Materials from buy signals
- Apply in Signals module: suppress Buy signal for Basic Materials regardless of SA score

-----

**Idea 2:** Add P/E Valuation Question
- New question between Q23 and Q24. Max +5 / Min -2. Fields: P/E Ratio (TTM)
- New raw score span: Max 75, Min -42 → normalize as `((raw + 42) / 117) * 100`

|P/E Range|Points|
|---------|------|
|15–35    |+5    |
|0–15     |+4    |
|35–50    |+4    |
|50–60    |+2    |
|60–80    |0     |
|80–100   |-2    |
|>100     |-5    |
|Negative |-2    |
|N/A      |0     |

-----

**Idea 3:** Require Q12 (EPS Growth) ≥ 2 as minimum gate for Buy signals at 75+
- Stocks with Q12 = 0 or 1 at high SA scores had weak forward returns vs peers with Q12 ≥ 2
- Apply in Signals module: if SA ≥ 75 and Q12 < 2 → downgrade signal to Monitor

-----

**Idea 4:** Selective Buy signal threshold raised to SA ≥ 80 — stocks 70-79 are not actionable

-----

**Idea 5:** When MC drops below 15, exit any stock whose score crossed below 70 since entry
- Simple threshold — no need to track prior score, just watch if it falls under 70

**Idea 6:** When MC drops below 15, exit any stock whose score dropped ≥6 pts since entry
- Catches high-scorers (80+) that stay above 70 but are deteriorating
- Combine with Idea 5 for maximum coverage — either condition triggers exit

-----

**Idea 7:** Quality Gate for 65-79 — require Q4≥3 AND Q3≥1 before issuing buy signals
- Q4≥3 = net margin ≥15%, Q3≥1 = positive cash flow growth
- Tested Oct 20: catches 11 FPs, loses 5 winners, win rate 37%→41% — needs more dates

**Idea 8:** Cap Q21 (Bollinger %B) at 4 points maximum
- Removes score inflation from extreme Bollinger readings without affecting breakouts
- Tested Oct 20: zero collateral damage at cap=4 — needs more dates

-----

**Idea 9:** Remove Q28 (Low Float Risk) — 94% of stocks score 0, zero variance, zero predictive value

**Idea 10:** Investigate Q31 inversion — penalized stocks (lower highs/lows) show higher win rate than non-penalized. May be a buy signal not a penalty. Needs multi-date confirmation.

**Idea 11:** Cap Q1+Q2+Q3 combined at 14 pts max — prevents growth-heavy stocks with zero quality metrics from inflating into 80+ artificially. Flag for multi-date testing.

**Idea 12 [HOLD]:** Require Q18 (Financial Strength) ≥ 1 for SA 80+ stocks — filters weak foundation stocks scoring high purely on growth. Not triggered on Oct 20 data (all 80+ already had Q18≥1). Needs dates where NVDA-type pattern appears.

**Idea 13 [HOLD]:** Balance penalty — deduct points when Q1+Q2+Q3 ≥ 12 BUT Q13+Q14+Q18 = 0. Growth/quality divergence = overextended entry risk. Too many winner casualties on Oct 20 — needs multi-date testing.

**Idea 14 [HOLD]:** Investigate Q23 (High P/E Trap) inversion — 7-date analysis shows penalized stocks had 84% WR vs 69% baseline. Contradicted by Oct 20 (0% WR for penalized). Conflicting — needs more dates before acting.

**Idea 15 [HOLD]:** Split Q26 (Sudden Drop) caution tier (-1) into a buy signal — 7-date analysis shows caution tier had 80% WR. Oct 20 shows 0% WR. Directly conflicting — needs more dates.

-----

**Note:** Keep your eyes open to find a flawless overextension sign without filtering breakouts

## Key Findings (2 dates analyzed)

**What's working:**
- 80+ group beats QQQ on both dates (+0.7% in bull, +6.4% in crash)
- Score separation is real — higher groups outperform lower groups consistently
- The one bad month (Feb 14) was a 2.7% frequency crash event — MC's job, not SA's

**What's not working:**
- Q20 (Sector Pref) and Q15 (Country) — strongest negative 'r' across all groups. Hurting the score
- Q1 (Sales Growth) — negative in every group. Rewarding the wrong stocks
- Q27, Q28 — dead weight. Zero variance
- SA total 'r' is only +0.029. Weak. Individual questions pulling in opposite directions

**Biggest opportunities:**
1. Fix or flip Q20, Q15, Q1 — actively making scores worse
2. Remove Q27, Q28 — no signal
3. Strengthen weight on Q4 (Profit Margin), Q3 (CF Growth), Q10 (Debt/Equity) — consistently positive 'r' in 75+ group
4. Exit rules — <70 cutoff is cleanest for crash protection

## After Filters — Oct 20 Results

|Group    |Before|  |After Filters|  |Alpha vs QQQ|
|---------|------|--|-------------|--|------------|
|         |Win%  |N |Win%         |N |            |
|**80+**  |50%   |10|**100%**     |6 |**+14.5%**  |
|**70-80**|39%   |28|**50%**      |14|**+2.7%**   |
|**60-70**|31%   |32|**53%**      |17|**+2.1%**   |
|50-60    |19%   |28|21%          |14|-6.3%       |
|<50      |17%   |6 |—            |— |—           |

**Filters applied:** BM exclusion (max 1) + crypto exclusion + score drop ≥6pts exit + unprofitable (Q4=0) exclusion + P/E >150 exclusion.

# Ideas after Master File optimization tests

# SA Backtest — Validated Findings After Data Cleanup

## Solid Kill Zones
*Statistically significant, 100% bootstrap confidence they underperform peers*

| Signal | Excess Return | Sample | Notes |
|--------|-------------:|-------:|-------|
| Q16 = Cash burn risk | -17.6% | 37 | Bulletproof — burning cash + high SA = trap |
| Q28 = Low float risk | -16.3% | 12 | Small sample but extreme signal |
| Q8 = "Good volume" only | -11.2% | 51 | No large cap / high volume = danger |
| Past 5D < -5% | -9.7% | 52 | Catching falling knives doesn't work |
| Tier 0 | -7.9% | 79 | Consistent underperformer |

These are rare enough that rejecting them costs almost nothing, but they remove the worst losses.

## Moderate Confidence
*Directionally real but needs more data to confirm size of effect*

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| SA 80+ beats peers | +2-4% monthly excess. Bootstrap CI: +0.78% to +4.07%. Real alpha, just smaller than raw averages suggest |
| Q21 "Buy zone" is a trap | -3.4% excess. These are value traps, not opportunities |
| SA < 70 underperforms peers | Consistent across dates, statistically significant |
| Past 5D > +15% | -6.6% excess. Buying the top reverses |

## Not Reliable (Do Not Use)
*Looked good in raw averages but collapsed under scrutiny*

| Finding | Why It Failed |
|---------|---------------|
| VIX-based rules | VIX ≥ 25 based on 1 single date. VIX ≥ 20 based on 9 events, dominated by one cluster |
| MC Score as independent signal | Correlates 0.52 with VIX — partially redundant, not independent |
| SA 90+ outperformance | Only 26 stocks, confidence interval crosses zero |
| Combined filters with < 50 observations | Sample too small to trust |
| Absolute return numbers | Driven by 2025 bull market and stock repetition, not the scoring system |
| "83% win rate" headline numbers | Disappears when you control for market direction |

## What To Test Next

1. Do the kill zones hold in bear vs bull separately on the cleaned datasets?
2. Does SA 80+ excess hold in the Old Format data at equivalent score levels?
3. Does Q16/Q28/Q8 show up in the Barchart data using fundamentals instead of SA scores?
4. Per-stock bear/bull pairs — does a stock that scores 80+ in bear AND bull outperform in both?

## Key Methodological Notes

- Excess return = stock return minus average return of all stocks on the same date (removes market direction)
- Bootstrap = 10,000 resamples to build confidence intervals
- Original dataset had 41 dates over 17 months, top 10 stocks drove 83% of total positive returns
- After cleanup: 5 clean dates, 492 rows, max 2 appearances per stock
