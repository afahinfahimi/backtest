# STOCK ANALYSIS SCORING SYSTEM (SA TEST)

**Lovable Trade V13 - Updated 2/1/2026**

---

## Stock Score Overview

- Score each stock provided by the user (via CSV or direct entry).
- Answer each question below and find the points that apply.
- Add all points to calculate the Raw Score and normalize it using the formula at the end of this document.
- Pull the data from connected FMP API. 

**Missing Data Handling:** If data unavailable for any question, do not estimate, follow the rules to assign points:
- For questions with positive-only answers (e.g., 0 to 6): assign middle value (e.g., 3)
- For questions with negative-only answer range: assign 0
- For questions with both positive and negative answer range (e.g., -5 to +5): assign 0
- For penalty questions (max 0): assign 0 (no penalty)

---

**Q26: The "Biotech Binary Event Burn" Volatility Cap**
- Fields: Sector, 10-Day Price Change %
- **Applies To:** Healthcare Sector (Biotechnology, Medical Devices, Drug Manufacturers)
- **Trigger:** 10-Day Price Change > 15%
- **Action:** Override Total Score to **maximum 55 (Normalized)** regardless of other points.

---

### Q27: Sustained Downtrend
- **Category:** Risk Penalty
- **Max:** 0 / **Min:** -3
- **Logic:** Check 1D, 5D, and 1M price changes. If ALL THREE are negative, deduct -3 points.
- **Conditions:**
  - 1D < 0% AND 5D < 0% AND 1M < 0%: **-3**
  - Otherwise: **0**
- **Data Source:** Quote endpoint (price changes)
- **Rationale:** A stock showing red across all three durations has no positive momentum at any timeframe. Wait for at least one reversal signal before entering, even if fundamentals score high.

---

### Q28: Sudden Drop / Slide
- **Category:** Risk Penalty
- **Max:** 0 / **Min:** -10
- **Logic:** Check for abnormal price drops. Evaluate each of the last 3 trading days individually (close-to-close). Also check cumulative 5-day return. Triggered by the HIGHEST matching tier only (no stacking):

  | Tier | Condition | Penalty |
  |------|-----------|---------|
  | Critical | Any single day ≥ 15% drop within last 3 days | -10 |
  | Severe | Any single day ≥ 10% drop within last 3 days | -5 |
  | Caution | Any single day ≥ 7% drop within last 3 days, OR cumulative 5-day return ≤ -10% | -3 |
  | None | No conditions met | 0 |

- **Data Source:** Historical daily prices (last 5 trading days, close prices)
- **Self-Healing:** Clears once the drop day falls outside the 3-day window. If decline continues, the 5-day cumulative condition sustains the Caution tier.
- **Rationale:** Tiered response to abnormal drops. 7%+ warrants caution. 10%+ signals something significant. 15%+ is catastrophic — effectively makes the stock untradeable by score alone.

---

### Q29: Short Interest Risk
- Category: Risk Penalty
- Max: 0 / Min: -3
- Logic: High short interest amplifies volatility in both directions.
  | Short % Float | Penalty |
  |---------------|---------|
  | > 30% | -3 |
  | > 20% | -2 |
  | > 15% | -1 |
  | ≤ 15% | 0 |
- Data Source: FMP institutional/short interest endpoint
- Rationale: Heavily shorted stocks have unpredictable, amplified moves. For 1-month swing trades, this adds risk regardless of direction.

---

## Final Score Calculation
- **Raw Score** = Sum of assigned points from all questions
**Current Config Reference (V13):**
- **Max Raw Score:** 70 points
- **Min Raw Score:** -41 points
- **Span:** 111 points
**Normalization Formula (auto-calculated from config):**
`((Raw Score - Min) / (Max - Min)) × 100`
*Current equivalent:* `((Raw Score + 41) / 111) × 100`
