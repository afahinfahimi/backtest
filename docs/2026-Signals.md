# Module3 - Signals
**Lovable Trade V16 — Updated 2/13/2026**

## Signals 
- This module considers all available results and information and issues Action Signals.
- Analysis (SA) and Market (MC) Scores as well as VIX are needed before the Signals are determined and issued.

## Market Conditions
There are two conditions a market is in. Normal Market and Override Mode.
The Override Mode is when VIX or MC are at a specific level that cancels out the effect of other scores.
Then Normal Market is when market is active and Signals are determined based on calculations and relationship of different scores to each other.
Below you see the three conditions possible with two groups of signals for each. One for the whole market and one for individual stocks considering their scores within that market condition.

## Universal Rule
| SA | Stock Signal | Manage Holdings | Color |
|----|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| < 55 | Find Better | Sell | t-red |

This rule applies in ALL conditions. SA < 55 always triggers Sell regardless of VIX or MC.
