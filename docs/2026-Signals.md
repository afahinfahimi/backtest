# Module3 - Signals
**Lovable Trade V16 — Updated 2/15/2026**

## Signals 
- This module considers all available results and information and issues Action Signals.
- Analysis (SA) and Market (MC) Scores as well as VIX are needed before the Signals are determined and issued.

## Required Input Data

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **SA Score** | Module 1 (Analysis) — Normalized Score | `((Raw Score + 42) / 112) * 100`. Range: 0–100 |
| **MC Score** | Module 2 (Market) — Normalized Score | `((Raw Score + 40) / 92) * 100`. Range: 0–100 |
| **VIX Level** | FMP API — `^VIX` Current Price (Level) | CBOE Volatility Index spot value |
| **Net Profit Margin** | Module 1 Q4 / FMP API — `Net Income ÷ Revenue (TTM)` | Used for Tier profitability check |
| **Market Cap** | FMP API — `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → `mktCap` | Full raw number (e.g., 50,000,000,000 = $50B) |
| **Annual Revenue Growth %** | Module 1 Q1 / FMP API | Used for Tier T3 "growth" condition |

## Market Conditions
There are two conditions a market is in. Normal Market and Override Mode.
The Override Mode is when VIX or MC are at a specific level that cancels out the effect of other scores.
Then Normal Market is when market is active and Signals are determined based on calculations and relationship of different scores to each other.
Below you see the three conditions possible with two groups of signals for each. One for the whole market and one for individual stocks considering their scores within that market condition.

## Signal Evaluation Logic

Signals are determined separately for the **Market** (one result, displayed in the top bar) and for each **Stock** (per row in the results table).

### Step 1: Determine Active Condition
- **Fields:** VIX Level (`^VIX` Price from FMP), MC Score (Module 2 Normalized)
- Evaluate in order — stop at first match:

| Priority | Condition | Trigger |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | VIX Override | VIX ≥ 25 |
| 2 | MC Override | VIX < 25 AND (MC < 15 OR MC > 80) |
| 3 | Regular Market | VIX < 25 AND MC 15–80 |

### Step 2: Issue Market Signal
- Use the **Market Signals** table from the active condition (Step 1).
- Displayed once in the top bar alongside QQQ price, MC Score, and VIX.

### Step 3: Issue Stock Signal (per stock row)
1. **Universal Rule first** — if SA < 55 → "Find Better / Sell" (t-red). Done. Skip Step 3b.
2. **If SA ≥ 55** — use the **Stock Signals** table from the active condition (Step 1).

## Universal Rule (Stock Signal Override)

## Tiers
Tiers define the max position size per stock.
**Tier Precedence:** If a stock qualifies for multiple tiers, assign the highest tier.
**Note:** Tiers are risk caps, not quality rankings. Score determines quality; tier determines maximum position size based on risk profile.

### Tier Field Definitions

| Field | Source | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| SA Score | Module 1 Normalized Score | `((Raw Score + 42) / 112) * 100` |
| Profitable | FMP API — Net Profit Margin (TTM) | Net Profit Margin ≥ 0% (from Module 1 Q4 field: `Net Income ÷ Revenue`) |
| Market Cap | FMP API — `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → `mktCap` | Full raw number. $50B = 50,000,000,000. $2B = 2,000,000,000. $100M = 100,000,000 |
| Growth | FMP API — Annual Revenue Growth % | Annual Revenue Growth % > 0% (from Module 1 Q1 field) |
| Small Profitable | FMP API — Net Profit Margin (TTM) | Net Profit Margin > 0% AND Market Cap ≤ $2B |

### Portfolio Concentration Limits

| Tier | SA | Condition | Max Position | Color |
|------|----|-----------|--------------|-------|
