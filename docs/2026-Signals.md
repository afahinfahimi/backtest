This module consolidates all color coding, grading, alerts, and action signals in one place.
Modules 1 (Analysis) and 2 (Market) focus solely on calculating scores. This module interprets them.

# Part 1 — Score Grades (Display Only)

Score Grades are **informational labels and colors** applied to SA and MC scores for display purposes.
They help contextualize the Master Signals but do not drive any actions on their own.

## SA Score Grades

| SA Score | Grade | Color |
|----------|-------|-------|
| 80 to 99 | Elite | t-green |
| 70 to 79 | Solid | t-teal |
| 60 to 69 | Potential | t-yellow |
| 50 to 59 | In Transition | t-orange |
| 40 to 49 | Weak | t-red |
| < 40 | Avoid | a-red |

## MC Score Grades

| MC Score | Grade | Color |
|----------|-------|-------|
| ≥ 70 | Too Strong | a-green |
| 55 to 70 | Strong | t-green |
| 30 to 54 | Normal | t-blue |
| 10 to 29 | Weak | t-yellow |
| < 10 | Very Weak | t-red |

# Part 2 — Alerts (Display Only)

Alerts are **non-scoring** visual indicators that provide context beyond scores.
They do not modify scores. They appear in tables, cards, and icons based on instructions.
Source from FMP API when available. Yahoo and Google Finance and web search otherwise.
Search the sources above to find any of the situations below; if found, add the Alert message
from the tables below. Accompany the message with the related color.

## Alert Display Rules
The alert columns show the same icon when alerts exist. They just show different color.
Clicking on an alert opens a toggle box with the content of the Alert below.

## Red Alerts (Negative / Risk)
**Color: t-red**

| Alert | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| SEC Investigation | Active SEC investigation, fraud, restatement |
| Legal Issues | Lawsuit, hearing, investigation, ruling news about the company or top executives |
| Forward Guidance Shows Decline | Forward guidance lowered by the company |
| EPS Expectation Lowered | Consensus EPS estimates cut within the last 90 days |
| Downgraded by Analysts | Analyst downgraded the stock within the last 30 days |
| Insider Selling | Top insider's selling within the last 6 months |

## Yellow Alerts (Caution / Neutral)
**Color: t-yellow**

| Alert | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| Earning Date Close | Earnings date is within the next 14 days |
| IPO (New Company) | Company's IPO was listed within the last 12 months |

## Green Alerts (Positive / Opportunity)
**Color: t-green**

| Upgrade by Analysts | Analysts upgraded the stock within the last month |
| Insider Buying | Top insiders bought stocks within the last 90 days |

# Part 3 — Master Signals (Action Signals)

Master Signals are the **final action signals**. Actions are based on these signals.
They are determined by the relationship between SA, MC, and VIX using conditional logic.

Signals are determined separately for the **Market** (one result, displayed in the top bar) and for each **Stock** (per row in the results table).

---

## Signal Evaluation Logic

### Step 1: Determine Active Condition
- **Fields:** VIX Level (`^VIX` Price from FMP), MC Score (Module 2 Normalized)
- Evaluate in order — stop at first match:

| Priority | Condition | Trigger |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | VIX Override | VIX ≥ 25 |
| 2 | MC Override | VIX < 25 AND (MC < 15 OR MC > 80) |
| 3 | Regular Market | VIX < 25 AND MC 15–80 |

### Step 2: Issue Market Signal
- Use the **Market Signals** table from the active condition (Step 1).
- Displayed once in the top bar alongside QQQ price, MC Score, and VIX.

### Step 3: Issue Stock Signal (per stock row)
1. **Universal Rule first** — if SA < 59 → apply Universal Rule. Done. Skip to next stock.
2. **If SA ≥ 59** — use the **Stock Signals** table from the active condition (Step 1).

---

## Universal Rule (Stock Signal Override)
- **Fields:** SA Score (Module 1 Normalized Score)
- **Applies to:** Every stock row, in ALL conditions, checked before condition-specific stock signals.

| SA Condition | Signal | Current Holdings Actions | Color |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| 35 to 59 | Find Better | Sell if Holding | t-yellow |
| < 35 | Avoid | Sell if holding | t-red |

---

## CONDITION 1: VIX Override
- **Trigger:** VIX Level (FMP `^VIX` Price) ≥ 25
- **Fields:** VIX Level, MC Score (Module 2 Normalized), SA Score (Module 1 Normalized)

### Market Signals

| VIX 25 to 29 | Any | Confident Buy | Market panic drop, buy including QQQ positions | 20% | t-green |

### Stock Signals

| VIX Condition | MC Condition | SA Condition | Signal | Manage Holdings | Color |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|-------|

# Part 4 — Tiers (Position Sizing)

Tiers define the max position size per stock.
**Tier Precedence:** If a stock qualifies for multiple tiers, assign the highest tier.
**Note:** Tiers are risk caps, not quality rankings. Score determines quality; tier determines maximum position size based on risk profile.

## Tier Field Definitions

| Field | Source | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| SA Score | Module 1 Normalized Score | `((Raw Score + 42) / 112) * 100` |
| Profitable | FMP API — Net Profit Margin (TTM) | Net Profit Margin ≥ 0% (from Module 1 Q4 field: `Net Income ÷ Revenue`) |
| Market Cap | FMP API — `/api/v3/profile/{symbol}` → `mktCap` | Full raw number. $50B = 50,000,000,000. $2B = 2,000,000,000. $100M = 100,000,000 |
| Growth | FMP API — Annual Revenue Growth % | Annual Revenue Growth % > 0% (from Module 1 Q1 field) |
| Small Profitable | FMP API — Net Profit Margin (TTM) | Net Profit Margin > 0% AND Market Cap ≤ $2B |

## Portfolio Concentration Limits

| Tier | SA Condition | Company Condition | Max Position Size | Color |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| T1 | ≥ 55 | Profitable (Net Profit Margin ≥ 0%) + Market Cap > $50B | $100,000 | t-green |
| T2 | ≥ 50 | Profitable (Net Profit Margin ≥ 0%) + Market Cap > $2B | $50,000 | t-blue |
| T3 | ≥ 50 | Market Cap > $100M + (Growth: Annual Revenue Growth > 0% OR Small Profitable: Net Profit Margin > 0% AND Market Cap ≤ $2B) | $20,000 | t-yellow |
| SELL | Does not qualify for any tier | $0 — Do not buy | t-red |
