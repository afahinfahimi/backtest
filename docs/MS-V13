## MS V12 Overview

The Master Score (MS) is the final decision layer. SA and MC are indicators — only the MS issues trading signals.

- **SA (Stock Analysis):** Evaluates individual stock quality (0-100). Answers: "Is this a good stock?"
- **MC (Market Condition):** Evaluates market environment (0-100). Answers: "Is the market safe?"
- **MS (Master Score):** Combines both into Go/No-Go signals. Answers: "Do I buy, and which one first?"

**Core Principle:** SA and MC never trigger trades on their own. The MS Zone Table governs all entry/exit decisions. The MS Formula is used for ranking only.

---

## 1. MS FORMULA (Ranking Only)

```
MS = SA + 0.75 × (100 - MC)
```

- **Range:** 0 to 175 (practical: ~25 to ~140)
- **Purpose:** Rank BUY-eligible stocks by priority. Higher MS = buy first.
- **NOT used for:** Entry/exit decisions (Zone Table governs those)

**Logic:** The formula rewards buying quality stocks during market fear. Low MC adds up to +75 bonus points. High MC adds near-zero bonus.

| SA | MC | MS | Interpretation |
|----|----|----|----------------|
| 80 | 30 | 132.5 | Great stock + fear = top priority |
| 80 | 50 | 117.5 | Great stock + neutral = high priority |
| 80 | 74 | 99.5 | Great stock + hot market = no new buys (Zone Table) |
| 65 | 30 | 117.5 | Good stock + fear = high priority |
| 65 | 50 | 102.5 | Good stock + neutral = moderate priority |
| 50 | 30 | 102.5 | Average stock + fear = moderate priority |

---

## 2. ENTRY RULES (Zone Table)

Evaluate in priority order. Stop at first match.

| Priority | Condition | Signal | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | VIX ≥ 28 | 🚨 VIX OVERRIDE | Buy QQQ immediately*. Ignore SA scores. Fixed position: 50% of T1 max. Exempt from §4 VIX Adjustment table. |
| 2 | MC < 20 | 🛑 PANIC | Stand down. All cash. SA unreliable. |
| 3 | MC 20-29 + SA ≥ 55 | 🟢 BUY | Fear. Aggressive buy opportunity. |
| 4 | MC 30-39 + SA ≥ 55 | 🟢 BUY | Oversold. Buy qualifying stocks. |
| 5 | MC 40-49 + SA ≥ 55 | 🟢 BUY | Cautious. Buy qualifying stocks. |
| 6 | MC 50-59 + SA ≥ 65 | 🟡 SELECTIVE BUY | Neutral. Only strong stocks. |
| 7 | MC 60-74 | ⛔ NO NEW BUYS | Overheated. Tighten stops. |
| 8 | MC ≥ 75 | ⛔ NO NEW BUYS | Euphoria. Take profits. |

**When multiple stocks qualify:** Use MS Formula to rank. Buy highest MS first.

---

## 3. EXIT RULES

Evaluate in priority order. Stop at first match.

| Priority | Condition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | VIX < 18 + QQQ profit > 10% | Exit VIX Override QQQ position only |
| 2 | Down -20% from entry | Sell — emergency stop loss |
| 3 | SA < 45 + down >15% | Sell — deteriorating quality |
| 4 | +20% T1 / +25% T2 / +30% T3 | Sell 50%, let rest run |
| 5 | 60 days held + SA < 55 | Sell — re-evaluation failed |
| 6 | Under 20 days held | Don't exit even if down |

---

## 4. POSITION SIZING

### Tier Limits (Max Position per Stock)

| Tier | Criteria | Max Position |
|------|----------|-------------|
| T1 | SA ≥ 55 + Profitable + Market Cap > $50B | $100,000 |
| T2 | SA ≥ 50 + Profitable + Market Cap > $2B | $50,000 |
| T3 | SA ≥ 50 + Market Cap > $100M + (growth OR small profitable) | $20,000 |
| SELL | Does not qualify for any tier | $0 — Do not buy |

**T3 Qualification Path A (Unprofitable Growth):**
- Unprofitable with at least 2 of 3 growth questions scoring ≥1 pt (Q1, Q2, Q3)

**T3 Qualification Path B (Small Profitable):**
- Profitable with Market Cap $100M–$2B

**Tier Precedence:** If a stock qualifies for multiple tiers, assign the highest tier.

**Note:** Tiers are risk caps, not quality rankings. Score determines quality; tier determines maximum position size based on risk profile.

### VIX Adjustment (Applied to Tier Limits)

| VIX Level | Adjustment | Example (T1) |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| < 18 | 100% of tier max | $100,000 |
| 18-25 | 75% of tier max | $75,000 |
| 25-35 | 50% of tier max | $50,000 |
| ≥ 35 | No new buys (Veto) — except VIX Override (§2 Priority 1) | $0

**Final Position = Tier Max × VIX Adjustment**

---

## 5. VETO INTEGRATION

Vetoes from SA or MC override all signals. If any veto triggers, the signal becomes AVOID regardless of scores.

### SA Vetoes (from SA V12)

| Veto | Trigger | Override |
|------|---------|----------|
| V1: Biotech Spike | Healthcare + 10D > 15% | Max Score 55 |
| V2: Momentum Trap | P/E > 50 + 10D < -5% | AVOID |
| V3: Cash Burn | Unprofitable + Negative OCF + MCap < $10B | AVOID |
| V4: Deterioration | Revenue + OpInc + OCF all declining QoQ | AVOID |
| V5: Momentum Divergence | 52W > 40% + 3M < -5% | AVOID |

### MC Vetoes (from MC V12)

| Veto | Trigger | Override |
|------|---------|----------|
| V1: Extreme Fear | VIX > 35 | Max MC Score 30 |
| V2: Market Crash | QQQ 52W < -30% | Max MC Score 20 |
| V3: Full Capitulation | QQQ below both MAs + VIX > 30 | PANIC ZONE |
