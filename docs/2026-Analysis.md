## Stock Score Overview

- Score each stock provided by the user (via CSV or direct entry).
- Answer each question below and find the points that apply.
- Add all points to calculate the Raw Score and normalize it using the formula at the end of this document.
- Pull the data from connected FMP API. 

**Missing Data Handling:** If data unavailable for any question, do not estimate, follow the rules to assign points:
- For questions with positive-only answers (e.g., 0 to 6): assign middle value (e.g., 3)
- For questions with negative-only answer range: assign 0
- For questions with both positive and negative answer range (e.g., -5 to +5): assign 0
- For penalty questions (max 0): assign 0 (no penalty)

- Trigger: P/E Ratio (TTM) > 50 AND 10-Day Price Change < -5%
- Points: -4

---

**Q24: Biotech Binary Event Burn** 
— Max Points: 0 
- Min Points: -3
- Fields: Sector, 10-Day Price Change %
- Applies to: Medical, Pharma 
- Trigger: 10D > 15% → Deduct -3 points

---

### Q25: Sustained Downtrend
- Fields: 1-Day Price Change %, 5-Day Price Change %, 1-Month Price Change %
— Max Points: 0 
- Min Points: -3
- **Logic:** Check 1D, 5D, and 1M price changes. If ALL THREE are negative, deduct -3 points.
- **Conditions:**
  - 1D < 0% AND 5D < 0% AND 1M < 0%: **-3**
  - Otherwise: **0**

---

### Q26: Sudden Drop / Slide
- Fields: Historical Daily Close Prices (last 5 trading days)
- **Category:** Risk Penalty
— Max Points: 0 
- Min Points: -6
- **Logic:** Check for abnormal price drops. Evaluate each of the last 3 trading days individually (close-to-close). Also check cumulative 5-day return. Triggered by the HIGHEST matching tier only (no stacking):

  | Tier | Condition | Penalty |
  |------|-----------|---------|
  | Critical | Any single day ≥ 15% drop within last 3 days | -6 |
  | Severe | Any single day ≥ 10% drop within last 3 days | -2 |
  | Caution | Any single day ≥ 7% drop within last 3 days, OR cumulative 5-day return ≤ -10% | -1 |
  | None | No conditions met | 0 |

- **Data Source:** Historical daily prices (last 5 trading days, close prices)
- **Self-Healing:** Clears once the drop day falls outside the 3-day window. If decline continues, the 5-day cumulative condition sustains the Caution tier.
- **Rationale:** Tiered response to abnormal drops. 7%+ warrants caution. 10%+ signals something significant. 15%+ is catastrophic — effectively makes the stock untradeable by score alone.

---

### Q27: Short Interest Risk
- Fields: Short % of Float
- Category: Risk Penalty
— Max Points: 0 
- Min Points: -1
- Logic: High short interest amplifies volatility in both directions.

  | Short % Float | Penalty |
  |---------------|---------|
  | > 20% | -1 |
  | ≤ 20% | 0 |

- Data Source: FMP institutional/short interest endpoint
- Rationale: Heavily shorted stocks have unpredictable, amplified moves. For 1-month swing trades, this adds risk regardless of direction.

---

### Q28: Low Float Risk
- Fields: Float Shares
- Category: Risk Penalty
— Max Points: 0 
- Min Points: -1
- Logic: Low float stocks have amplified price swings on normal volume.

  | Float | Penalty |
  |-------|---------|
  | < 20M shares | -1 |
  | ≥ 20M shares | 0 |

- Data Source: FMP company profile (float shares)
- Rationale: Minor risk factor. Low float amplifies volatility but isn't inherently negative.

---

### Q29: Sector Performance vs Peers
- Fields: 1-Month Price Change %, Sector Average 1-Month Return %
- Category: Momentum
- Max: +1 / Min: -1
- Logic: Compare stock's 1M return vs its sector average 1M return.

  | Condition | Points |
  |-----------|--------|
  | Outperforms sector by > 10% | +1 |
  | Within ±10% of sector | 0 |
  | Underperforms sector by > 10% | -1 |

- Data Source: FMP sector performance + stock quote
- Rationale: Relative strength vs peers indicates stock-specific quality beyond market/sector movement.

---

### Q30: 5-Day Relative Strength (Alpha) 🆕 NEW V15
- Fields: Stock 5-Day Price Change %, QQQ 5-Day Price Change %
- Formula: Alpha = Stock 5D % minus QQQ 5D %
- Category: Momentum
— Max Points: +3 
- Min Points: -3
- **Evaluate in order listed (stop at first match):**

  | Condition | Points |
  |-----------|--------|
  | Stock UP & Market DOWN (true alpha) | +3 |
  | Alpha ≥ +5% (beating market by 5%+) | +2 |
  | Alpha ≥ 0% (beating market) | +1 |
  | Alpha -5% to 0% (slightly lagging) | 0 |
  | Alpha < -5% (badly lagging market) | -2 |
  | Stock DOWN & Market UP (stock-specific problem) | -3 |

- Data Source: FMP quote (stock 5D change) + QQQ quote (market 5D change)
- Rationale: Stock move relative to market isolates stock-specific strength (alpha). Stocks up while market is down had 82.1% win rate. Stocks down while market is up had 47.8% win rate. Combined with Q15 change, improved SA correlation from r=0.152 to r=0.173 (+14%).

---

### Q31: Trend Deterioration (Lower Lows & Lower Highs)
- Fields: Daily OHLC (last 30 trading days)
- Category: Risk Penalty
— Max Points: 0 
- Min Points: -3

**Calculation:**
1. Find swing highs: days where the high > highs of 2 days before and 2 days after
2. Find swing lows: days where the low < lows of 2 days before and 2 days after
3. Compare last 2-3 swing highs: are they decreasing?
4. Compare last 2-3 swing lows: are they decreasing?
5. Both decreasing → penalty

  | Condition | Points |
  |-----------|--------|
  | Lower highs AND lower lows (2+ swing points each) | -3 |
  | Otherwise | 0 |

- Data Source: FMP `/api/v3/historical-price-full/{symbol}` (daily OHLC)
- Rationale: Stocks making lower lows and lower highs are in a structural downtrend regardless of other indicators. Detects topping patterns that momentum questions miss.

---

## Final Score Calculation
- **Raw Score** = Sum of assigned points from all questions

**Current Config Reference:**
- **Max Raw Score:** 70 points
- **Min Raw Score:** -42 points
- **Span:** 112 points

**Normalization Formula (auto-calculated from config):**
`((Raw Score - Min) / (Max - Min)) × 100`
*Current equivalent:* `((Raw Score + 42) / 112) * 100`
